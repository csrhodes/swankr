#+AUTHOR: Christophe Rhodes
#+EMAIL: csr21@cantab.net
#+OPTIONS: H:0 toc:nil
* OPEN #1 printed output not redirected to slime repl
  The output from functions performing printing is sent to the
  standard output of the process running =swank()=, not to an emacs
  stream.
* OPEN #2 popping beyond inspector history crashes
  Inspecting something and hitting =l= causes the R debugger to pop
  up from trying to send =NULL= in a sexp to Emacs.

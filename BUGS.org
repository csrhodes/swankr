* OPEN #1 printed output not redirected to slime repl
  The output from functions performing printing is sent to the
  standard output of the process running =swank()=, not to an emacs
  stream.
* OPEN #2 popping beyond inspector history crashes
  Inspecting something and hitting =l= causes the R debugger to pop
  up from trying to send =NULL= in a sexp to Emacs.
* OPEN #3 source reference in compile-string-for-emacs
  It would be good if we could associate the expressions in the string
  with a reference to the corresponding source.  Unfortunately, emacs
  only passes the buffer position in bytes (or maybe characters),
  whereas R's srcrefs work with lines and columns.
